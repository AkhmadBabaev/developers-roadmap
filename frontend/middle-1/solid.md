# SOLID principles

## Prerequisites
* [Basic design principles](./design.md)
* [OOP](./oop.md)

## The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
* What is The Single Responsibility Principle?
* What is the goal of SRP?
* What is the Responsibility in the context of the SRP?
* What does "reason to change" mean in the context of the SRP?
* How Information Hiding as a criterion for system decomposition is related to SRP?
* What are the rules that balance SRP in the opposite direction and help to avoid overdoing the decomposition?
* Can we apply SRP if we have no forecast how system can evolve (for example we are completely unfamiliar with the project)?
